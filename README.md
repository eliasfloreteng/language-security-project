# Python Pickle Module Security Vulnerability Demonstration

## Background

Python's `pickle` module is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. "Pickling" converts a Python object hierarchy into a byte stream, and "unpickling" converts that byte stream back into an object hierarchy. While convenient for persisting data or inter-process communication, the `pickle` module is explicitly documented as **not secure** for untrusted data. Maliciously crafted pickle data can lead to arbitrary code execution during the unpickling process. This vulnerability arises because the pickle byte stream contains opcodes that are executed sequentially upon deserialization, including the ability to call arbitrary functions with supplied arguments via the `__reduce__` method.

## Goal

This project aims to explore the security risks associated with Python's `pickle` library. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate how manipulated pickled files can lead to arbitrary code execution. We will also investigate and propose mitigation strategies or alternatives to safely deserialize Python objects.

The project directly relates to the Language-Based Security course, as it investigates language features (serialization and deserialization) and their exploitation in Python, a mainstream programming language. By focusing on the pickle module, we will examine how language design and unsafe library APIs contribute to common vulnerabilities. This work will reinforce core course concepts such as secure API design and deserialization attacks.

## Methodology

This project includes two main demonstrations of pickle deserialization vulnerabilities:

### 1. Offline Tampering

This scenario demonstrates how an attacker can modify a pickled file stored on disk to achieve arbitrary code execution when a vulnerable application later loads the tampered file.

- `offline_tampering/vulnerable_app.py`: This script simulates a simple application that loads a pickled object from a file (`data.pickle`). It represents a common scenario where an application might deserialize data without proper validation.
- `offline_tampering/generate_malicious_pickle.py`: This script crafts a malicious pickled payload. The payload leverages the `__reduce__` method to execute a system command (e.g., `echo Malicious code executed!`) when unpickled. The `__reduce__` method is a special method in Python that allows objects to define how they should be pickled. When an object implementing `__reduce__` is pickled, this method is called, and its return value (a string or a tuple) dictates how the object is represented in the pickle stream. If a tuple is returned, its first element is a callable object, and the second is a tuple of arguments for that callable. During unpickling, this callable is invoked with the provided arguments. Attackers can abuse this mechanism by making `__reduce__` return a dangerous callable (like `os.system` or `eval`) and a malicious command as its argument, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- `offline_tampering/secure_app.py`: This script demonstrates a safer approach to handling pickled data by using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to verify the integrity of the pickled data before unpickling.

### 2. Web App Demonstration

This scenario illustrates how deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in web applications if a web endpoint deserializes untrusted data directly from user input. This also highlights a potential risk in supply-chain attacks, where a legitimate GitHub repository or a third-party library might inadvertently contain or use a maliciously crafted pickle file, compromising systems that import or process it.

- `web_app/diary_app.py`: This is a Flask web application that simulates a simple diary. It allows users to "save" and "load" diary entries, which are serialized using `pickle`. The vulnerability lies in the "load" functionality, which directly unpickles user-provided data without proper validation.
- `web_app/generate_malicious_diary.py`: This script generates a malicious pickled diary entry that, when unpickled by `diary_app.py`, will execute arbitrary code on the server.

To run this demonstration:

1.  Generate the malicious payload:

```bash
python web_app/generate_malicious_diary.py
```

2.  Start the Flask web application:

```bash
python web_app/diary_app.py
```

3. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000/`. Use the "Load Diary" functionality to load the malicious diary entry. The server will execute the code embedded in the pickled data, demonstrating the RCE vulnerability.

## Results

For the **Offline Tampering** demonstration, when `offline_tampering/vulnerable_app.py` attempts to unpickle the malicious data generated by `offline_tampering/generate_malicious_pickle.py`, the system command embedded within the payload will be executed. This demonstrates the arbitrary code execution vulnerability inherent in unpickling untrusted data. The output "Malicious code executed!" will confirm the successful execution of the injected command, highlighting how easily an attacker can achieve control over the system by manipulating serialized data.

For the **Web App Demonstration**, when a malicious pickled diary entry generated by `web_app/generate_malicious_diary.py` is sent to and unpickled by `web_app/diary_app.py`, the arbitrary code embedded within the payload will be executed on the server. This demonstrates Remote Code Execution (RCE) in a web application context.

Both demonstrations underscore the critical importance of validating and securing deserialization processes, especially when dealing with data from untrusted sources.

## Mitigation Strategies

To safely handle serialization and deserialization in Python, it is crucial to avoid `pickle` when dealing with untrusted data. Safer alternatives and practices include:

- **Using Data-Only Serialization Formats**: For untrusted data, prefer formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), YAML, or MessagePack. These formats are designed for data interchange and do not inherently support arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
  - **JSON**: Lightweight, human-readable, and language-agnostic. Python's built-in `json` module is suitable for this.
  - **MessagePack**: A binary serialization format that is more compact and faster than JSON, suitable for performance-critical applications.
  - **Note on PyYAML and jsonpickle**: While JSON and YAML are generally safer, it's important to note that certain libraries like `PyYAML` (when using `yaml.load` without specifying a safe loader) and `jsonpickle` can also be vulnerable to similar deserialization attacks if not used carefully, as they might allow deserialization of arbitrary Python objects or execution of code. Always ensure you are using safe loading functions (e.g., `yaml.safe_load` for PyYAML) and understand the security implications of any serialization library.
- **Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**: If you must use `pickle` for trusted data (e.g., internal communication where data integrity is paramount), generate a cryptographic signature (e.g., using `hmac`) for the pickled data. The receiver can then validate this signature before unpickling to ensure the data has not been tampered with. This protects against offline tampering but does not mitigate vulnerabilities if the original source of the pickled data is compromised.
- **Restricting Globals**: For advanced use cases where `pickle` is unavoidable, you can customize `Unpickler.find_class` to restrict which classes and functions can be imported during unpickling. This acts as a whitelist, preventing the deserialization of dangerous objects. However, this is complex and prone to error, as it requires a deep understanding of all possible "gadgets" that could be exploited.
