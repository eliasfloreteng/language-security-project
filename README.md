## üéØ Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Offline File Tampering

1. Application saves user sessions as pickle files
2. Attacker gains file system access
3. Attacker replaces legitimate pickle with malicious one
4. Application loads tampered file and executes malicious code

**Demonstration**: `python exploit_demo.py --offline`

### Scenario 2: Web Application Exploitation

1. Web app accepts pickle data via API
2. Attacker crafts malicious payload
3. Payload is sent as base64, file upload, or raw data
4. Server unpickles data and executes attack code

**Demonstration**:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start vulnerable app
python vulnerable_app.py

# Terminal 2: Run web attacks
python exploit_demo.py --web
```

### Scenario 3: Supply Chain Attack

1. Attacker compromises data pipeline
2. Legitimate pickle files are replaced with malicious ones
3. Applications consuming the data execute attack code
4. Attack spreads through the system

**Demonstration**: Modify existing pickle files in `data/` directory

## üõ°Ô∏è Defense Strategies

### 1. Never Unpickle Untrusted Data

**‚ùå Vulnerable Pattern**:

```python
import pickle
user_data = pickle.loads(untrusted_input)  # DANGEROUS!
```

**‚úÖ Safe Alternative**:

```python
import json
user_data = json.loads(untrusted_input)  # Safe for untrusted data
```

### 2. Use Secure Serialization Formats

**For Untrusted Data**:

- JSON (human-readable, widely supported)
- MessagePack (binary, efficient)
- Protocol Buffers (schema validation)

**For Trusted Data with Integrity Checks**:

- HMAC-signed pickle (demonstrated in project)
- Encrypted serialization

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

```python
# Validate data structure before processing
def validate_user_data(data):
    required_fields = ['username', 'email', 'permissions']
    if not all(field in data for field in required_fields):
        raise ValueError("Invalid data structure")
    return data
```

### 4. Principle of Least Privilege

- Run applications with minimal required permissions
- Use sandboxing for untrusted code execution
- Implement network segmentation

### 5. Detection and Monitoring

**File Integrity Monitoring**:

```python
import hashlib

def verify_file_integrity(filename, expected_hash):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        file_hash = hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest()
    return file_hash == expected_hash
```

**Suspicious Pattern Detection**:

- Monitor for pickle files in unexpected locations
- Scan for suspicious function names in serialized data
- Log deserialization operations

## üî¨ Technical Analysis

### Understanding Pickle Format

Pickle uses a stack-based virtual machine with opcodes:

```python
import pickletools
import pickle

# Analyze pickle structure
data = pickle.dumps({"key": "value"})
pickletools.dis(data)
```

**Common Malicious Opcodes**:

- `GLOBAL`: Import modules and functions
- `REDUCE`: Call functions with arguments
- `BUILD`: Modify object attributes

### The `__reduce__` Method

The core of pickle exploitation:

```python
class MaliciousClass:
    def __reduce__(self):
        # This method defines how to reconstruct the object
        # Attackers abuse it to execute arbitrary code
        return (os.system, ('malicious_command',))
```

### Attack Payload Analysis

**Safe Payload Structure**:

```
MARK    # Start of list
GLOBAL  # Load class
TUPLE   # Arguments tuple
REDUCE  # Call constructor
STOP    # End of pickle
```

**Malicious Payload Structure**:

```
GLOBAL  # Load os.system
MARK    # Start arguments
STRING  # Command string
TUPLE   # Arguments tuple
REDUCE  # Execute command!
STOP    # End of pickle
```
